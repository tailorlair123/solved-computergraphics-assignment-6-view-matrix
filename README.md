View matrix

This assignment (start from file index.html) is similar to the one in assignments 4 and 5. It requires to create a set of view matrices in file view.js. The type of view required each time, is specified in the comments of file view.js. By pressing the space bar, you can check whether your matrices matches the correct solution.




In this exercise you must write yourself (that is, not using a functionality provided by any library) the view matrices. You can however use library functions to create rotation matrices, scaling matrices, shear matrices, translation matrices, and to compute vector cross products, matrix products, inversion or transposition.
